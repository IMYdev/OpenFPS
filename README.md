# OpenFPS
 This project has been made in the hope to help people build FPS games in godot as there's a lack in this field I believe
 You can base your FPS games off of OpenFPS and it will save you some serious time rather than creating everything from scratch.
# Features:
 1. 2 hands holding a gun.
 2. Gun that shoots on pressing the left mouse button.
 3. Reloading mechanism that just works.
 4. A lot of bugged code.
 5. Seriously just make a PR and fix problems.
