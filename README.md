# OpenFPS
 OpenFPS is a project that aims to help people build first-person shooter (FPS) games in Godot, as this field is lacking interest around the godot comuunity.
# Features:
 1. Basic FPS character controller.
 2. Weapon system that supports only a gun as of now.
 3. Reloading mechanism that works.
 4. An enemy.
 5. Hitscan weapon mechanisem.
 6. HUD showing remaining bullets.
