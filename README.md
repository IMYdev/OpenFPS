# OpenFPS
 OpenFPS is a project that aims to help people build first-person shooter (FPS) games in Godot as there's a lack of FPS games       available in Godot, and OpenFPS hopes to fill this gap.
# OpenFPS provides a number of features that can be used to build FPS games, including:
  1.A basic FPS character controller.
  2.A weapon system that supports a gun.
  3.A reloading mechanism that works.
  4.A lot of bugged code that needs to be fixed.
  5.An open enivronment for future contributions.
 
By using OpenFPS, you can save yourself a significant amount of time and effort in building your own FPS game. However, you should be prepared to fix a lot of bugs before you can get a working game.

OpenFPS is still under development, but I believe it is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to build an FPS game in Godot.
