# OpenFPS
 This project has been made in the hope to help people build FPS games in godot as there's a lack in this field I believe
 You can base your FPS games off of OpenFPS and it will save you some serious time rather than creating everything from scratch.
# Features:
 1. Basic FPS character controller.
 2. Weapon system that supports only a gun as of now.
 3. Reloading mechanism that works.
 4. An open enivronment for future contributions.
 
By using OpenFPS, you can save yourself a significant amount of time and effort in building your own FPS game.

OpenFPS is still under development, but it is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to build an FPS game in Godot.
